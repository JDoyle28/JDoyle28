Hi, I’m @JDoyle28

I’m interested in all things concerning technology, environment, economy, and well-being. I’m currently learning about computation and software development, though I am excited to widen my knowledge through the combination of many of my interests. I’m looking to collaborate my skill sets with those that you can offer and build a better tomorrow. Being a dedicated student, father, and environmentalist, I can say with assurance, that I am a qualified candidate who is up for the task. Reach me by email at any time for references, qualifications, or just to chat about important topics.
